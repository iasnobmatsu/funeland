过去的事会成为缠绕着我们的幽灵。仿佛已经抛下的东西终会在某一瞬间归来。记录着的和未被记录的，又有什么区别？

或许这个博客没有意义，也或许一切在百年后都将成为互联网上的尘埃，更或许许久之后，我、这个博客、我所认知的世界都将不复存在，但此时此刻，我坐在电脑前能够忘记烦恼和忧愁。


Carpe diem.

<blockquote style="font-family:'NotoS'">
<pre style="font-family:'NotoS'">
Half my life's in books' written pages
Storing facts learned from fools and from sages
You view the earth

Oh, sing with me, this mournful dub
Sing with me, sing for a year
Sing for the laughter, and sing for the tear
Sing with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away

Oh, sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter, and sing for the tear
Sing it with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away
</pre>
