I wanted to convert a latex article into a markdown blog that can be posted here on this website. After some google search, I came across [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html) which did what I want. 

After installing Pandoc, the command `pandoc -s -o example.tex example.md` can be usedto convert a `.tex` file to a `.md` file. 

Pandoc can also convert other formats of files including but not limited to Jupyter notebook, HTML, Word docx and more. This may be a very useful tool for now and in the future.
