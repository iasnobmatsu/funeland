想写个自己可以用的乐理笔记。最终目标是编曲。

这份笔记将根据 [Music Theory for Guitar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukP7BOd6WOI&list=PLDNPXoSAAaRJ9CoWhCyxeqmKRKvZv0iu4) 编写。

latest update: 目前看完了octave.

## Intervals


half-step (semi-tone): One fret apart. Notes that are a half-step apart are minor 2nd or flat 2. 
whole-step (whole tone): Two frets apart. Notes thare are a whole-step apart are major 2nd or 2.

Similarly,

|interval|steps apart|
|--|--|
| minor 2nd| 0.5 |
| major 2nd| 1   |
| minor 3rd| 1.5 |
| major 3rd| 2 |
| perfect 4th | 2.5|
| diminished 5th (tritone)| 3| 
| perfect 5th| 3.5 | 
| augmented 5th, sharp 5, minor/flat 6| 4 | 
| major 6, diminished 7| 4.5 |
| minor 7| 5|
| major 7 | 5.5 |
| octave (8) | 6 |

An octave is 12 frets apart. 

On a guitar with standard tuning, the notes from the 6th to 1st string are E, A, D, G, B, E. The intervals between strings are 4th (perfect 4th) except between G and B which are 3rd (major 3rd).

### Interval shapes on multiple strings on guitar

Minor 2nd: 4 frets back on the neighboring higher string

-5---
```
Major 2nd: 3 frets back on the neighboring higher string

```

-2---
-5---
```

etc.

### octave shapes

An octave shape can be build using two frets above the current note two strings higher

when the octave is across the second string
